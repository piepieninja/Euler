# Proejct Euler
[Project Euler Problem List](https://projecteuler.net/archives)

## About

*notice*
These questions are practice and you should solve them independently.
Each algorithm will be written in a random language or set of languages.

Languages Used:
* C++
* Java
* Python
* Ruby
* R
* Bash/Shell
* javascript

## How To Use

To run a specific problem in all of the languages listed above use the make
command followed by assigning the problem number. The code should look
something like this:

<code> $ make problem=001 </code>

that will contruct all of the files nessesary to run problem 001 and then
remove all of the unnessesary files. To run other problems use the same
syntax:

<code> $ make problem=### </code>

<i>note:</i> this can only be done inside of the problems directory!
