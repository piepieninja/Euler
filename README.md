[Project Euler Problem List](https://projecteuler.net/archives)


## About

*notice*
These questions are practice and you should solve them independently.
Each algorithm will be written in a random language or set of languages.

Languages Used:
* C++
* Java
* Python
* Ruby
* R
* Bash/Shell
* javascript

## How To Use

To run a specific problem in all of the languages listed above use the make
command followed by assigning the problem number. The code should look
something like this:

<code> $ make problem=001 </code>

that will contruct all of the files nessesary to run problem 001, run problem
001, and then remove all of the unnessesary files. To run other problems
use the same syntax:

<code> $ make problem=### </code>

<i>note:</i> this can only be done inside of the problems directory!
